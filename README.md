# SELECTER
a small page to help select people from a group
## Features
### Select between 1 and 5 people
Have everyone touch the monitor. The number of people selected in the menu will be selected from the group.

You need more people touching the monitor than the number in the menu!

### Split people between teams
Have everyone touch the monitor. The number of teams selected in the menu will be selected.

Note, you need at least the amount of people touching the monitor that you want teams...

### Randomise the order of people
Have everyone touch the monitor. The touches will be randomly given a number.

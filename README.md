# ***Chose!***

[A small page to help select people from a group](https://jbellue.github.io/chose/)

Open source, no-app-needed clone of [the excellent app Chwazi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tendadigital.chwaziApp&hl=en)

## If the app's so good, why a clone?

* I was bored
* No need to install anything, that's better, probably?
* 0% tracking (I'm not implying chwazi does anything naughty. But here I know nothing evil goes on)
* I wanted the possibility to give a random number to each person
* why not?

## Features

   You need at least the amount of people touching the screen that you want teams...
